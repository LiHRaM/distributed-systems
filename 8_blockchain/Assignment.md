# Topic 8 - Blockchain

* Explain the characteristics of the blocks in a blockchain (e.g.: immutability, linear growth)
* Explain how the crypto tools used in blockchain work (hash function, signature, merkle tree, hash pointer) and how they are used in the blockchain
* Explain why Paxos consensus is not enough for a blockchain, e.g.: to protect against the double spending conundrum
* Bitcoin: explain the structure of the transaction and how they are verified by the miner
* Smart contracts: discuss the gas prices for different primitives, e.g.: for Solidity

Material: blockchain slides, Bitcoin paper, Solidity tutorial (lecture 13)
